# Plan: Display Weather Information on National Trust Property Pages

# Objective

To enhance the user experience on National Trust property information pages by displaying real-time weather data for the property's location. This should ideally be A/B tested to understand the impact of these changes on user engagement.

# Constraints

- Only a single JavaScript script can be added to the National Trust site.
- No changes to the backend or other parts of the website are allowed.
- Weather data should be sourced from the provided mock endpoint or an external weather service.
- The script must be efficient and not degrade the performance of the website.

# Steps to Implement the Solution

1. Understand the Current Website Structure

- *Analyze the DOM*: Use browser DevTools to inspect the structure of a typical property information page.
        - Could use globalDataLayer.subRegion to query an Api 
- *Identify Target Element*: Determine where to insert the weather information (e.g., near the property's summary or main image).
- *Check Existing Data*: Look at localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies, and global JavaScript scope for any useful data that can aid in identifying the property's location.

2. Source Weather Data

- *Mock Endpoint*: Use the provided mock endpoint for weather data.
- *External Service*: Set up a plan to use OpenWeatherMap if required, ensuring API keys are not exposed.

3. Fetch Coordinates

- *Geocoding API*: Use OpenWeatherMap's Geocoding API to get latitude and longitude for the property's location.
- *Handle Errors*: Implement error handling for cases where the location is not found or the API fails.

4. Fetch Weather Data

- *Weather API*: Fetch weather data using the coordinates obtained.
- *Parse Response*: Extract necessary information such as temperature, weather description, and icon.

5. Display Weather Information

- *Create HTML Elements*: Dynamically create and style HTML elements to display the weather information.
- *Insert into DOM*: Insert these elements into the identified target location on the page.

6. Error Handling

- *Display Errors*: Show user-friendly error messages if weather data cannot be retrieved.

7. A/B Testing (Optional)

- *Implement A/B Test*: If possible, set up an A/B testing mechanism to display weather information to only a subset of users and track engagement metrics.
